HappyPlacesApp is an application created with Jetpack-Compose that allows users to mark their own places on a map and access them with a list. Using an OpenStreetMap map, markers can be set by a long tap, to which a title, a description and a picture can be added. Markers that have already been set can also be edited later. The app also provides an overview of all saved locations and the option to navigate to the current location. The data is retained even if the screen is rotated, as it is managed in the ViewModel
